Hi, I am someone who has adopted lifelong development as a principle in my life. For this reason, I always try to learn new technologies and think about how I can use what I have learned effectively within the team. Thus, I try not only to write code, but also to contribute to this language, knowing that writing code is a language. In this context, I can say; I have no doubt that we will mutually contribute to your company.
